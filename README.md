# Bus Mall
## An Imagined Marketing Survey
### By Ryan Manro

This application was created for an imaginary magazine that would be distributed to passengers of a bus, a la SkyMall on airplanes. The purpose would be to have survey participants choose which product they would rather buy out of choices presented. At the end of the survey, results are shown in bar graph form to be used by the Bus Mall marketing team. This team also has access to a settings page (settings.html) that allows them to set how many images and survey rounds they would like to conduct.

This project used the follwing:
